1. **Expandable Output Text (DCR_OutputText_Exp) :**
An output text that collapses the text contents when it exceeds a specified limit. It will show an icon that will toggle the full text, either in the same space or as a pop-up. This will be particularly useful when we want to display very long text on the UI.
1. **Masked Output Text (DCR_OutputText_Mask) :**
An output text part of which's value can be masked (based on a regular expression). It will show an optional icon (based on configuration parameters) that will show the full text. This will be useful when it is necessary to display only partial information on the user screen (credit card numbers, SSN, ...).
